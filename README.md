# Build a Link Previewer With Puppeteer & Serverless Functions

This article is to show how we can easily set up serverless functions with our front-end application, we'll be building an app with a custom link previewer component. 

This component sends a request with a URL to our serverless function. The function then uses Puppeteer to get metadata from the target site using the URL and generate a screenshot of the site. 

The function sends the metadata and screenshots back to the component on our front-end to display it as a link preview in the application.
